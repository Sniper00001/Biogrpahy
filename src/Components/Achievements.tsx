          Einstein's work on the theory of relativity revolutionized our
          understanding of space, time, and gravity. His famous equation, E=mcÂ²,
          showed the equivalence of energy and mass, laying the foundation for
          nuclear energy and atomic bombs. He received the Nobel Prize in
          Physics in 1921 for his discovery of the photoelectric effect, which
          demonstrated the particle-like properties of light.

          In addition to his scientific achievements, Einstein was a prominent
          advocate for civil rights, pacifism, and education. He became an
          international symbol of intellectual curiosity and creativity.

          Einstein continued his scientific work and made important
          contributions to the field, but he also focused on more philosophical
          and humanitarian endeavors. He remained a vocal advocate for civil
          rights and spoke out against racism and discrimination.

          Albert Einstein passed away on April 18, 1955, at the age of 76, in
          Princeton, New Jersey. His legacy endures through his scientific
          contributions, which transformed our understanding of the universe, as
          well as his humanitarian efforts, which inspire people to this day.
