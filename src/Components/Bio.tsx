        <p>
          Albert Einstein was a renowned theoretical physicist who is widely
          regarded as one of the greatest scientific minds in history. He was
          born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg, German
          Empire. His father, Hermann Einstein, was an engineer, and his mother,
          Pauline Einstein, was a homemaker.

          Early Life and Education: Einstein showed an early interest in
          mathematics and science, and at a young age, he was already delving
          into complex books on these subjects. However, he had difficulty
          fitting into the traditional school system due to his rebellious
          nature and dislike for rote learning. His family eventually moved to
          Munich, where he attended a new school, and he excelled in subjects he
          was passionate about. In 1896, at the age of 17, Einstein enrolled at
          the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich, Switzerland, to pursue a
          degree in physics and mathematics. He graduated in 1900 and became a
          Swiss citizen in 1901.

          The Annus Mirabilis: In 1905, Einstein published four groundbreaking
          papers that would revolutionize the field of physics. This year became
          known as his "Annus Mirabilis" (miracle year). These papers addressed
          different topics: The photoelectric effect, which laid the foundation
          for quantum theory, for which he would later receive the Nobel Prize
          in Physics in 1921. Brownian motion, confirming the existence of atoms
          and molecules, which had been a topic of debate among scientists.
          Special Theory of Relativity, introducing the famous equation E=mc²,
          which relates energy (E) and mass (m) in the context of high-speed
          motion. The equivalence of mass and energy, an extension of his
          Special Theory of Relativity. General Theory of Relativity and Fame:
          Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, published in 1915, provided a
          new understanding of gravity, explaining it as the curvature of
          spacetime caused by mass and energy. This theory revolutionized the
          understanding of the universe and made Einstein an international
          celebrity. <br />

          During the 1920s and 1930s, Einstein traveled extensively, giving
          lectures and advocating for pacifism, civil rights, and Zionism. He
          left Germany in 1933 due to the rise of the Nazi regime, and he
          settled in the United States, where he accepted a position at the
          Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.
